## Introduction
In these GitHub repository I stored the full code examples of my book HornetQ Messaging Developers' Guide (a.k.a HornetQMDG)

The framework is quite outdated but I like to think that in the desperate race for the latest technology (Kafka looks like the winner from the latest polls), someone might be interested in understanding some outdated technologies. 
Sometimes studying history could be self-satisfactory from someone.
Basically you need to have a fully installed instance of HornetQ running in your machine to make the examples work. 
Apart from chapter 8 that uses only the jars for runnning a standalone distance the other chapter examples heavily depends of the server running in a standalone instance. 
Because I never really appreciate the Ecplise ecosystem the whole book examples are based on NetBeans develpment platform. You need it for compiling the code (I told you it is a little bit outdated!).  

If you need a copy of the book in some pirate sites or libgen you could find the PDF. However, please rememenber that it took mee six month to write it while I was struggling with my babies during the night. It took me some of my most unvaluable resource: my personal time. So in case you would not like to spend 27$ on Amazon [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/HornetQ-Messaging-Developers-Guide-Giacomelli-ebook/dp/B009X5KIGE/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=hornetq&qid=1599849896&sr=8-1) to buy it you could at least buy me a coffee

Otherwise, nevermind I will not search you to grab my money back.Karma will do it for me :-). My Linkedin profile is this https://www.linkedin.com/in/pgiacome/
