## Introduction
In these GitHub repository I stored the full code examples of my book HornetQ Messaging Developers' Guide (a.k.a HornetQMDG)

 The framework is quite outdated, but I like to think that in the desperate race for the latest technology (Kafka looks like the winner from the latest polls), someone might be interested in understanding some outdated technologies. 
Sometimes studying history could be self-satisfactory from someone.

Basically you need to have a fully installed instance of HornetQ running in your machine to make the examples work Chapter 2 explains in dept how to install such working instance on a NIX or WINDOWS machine.

Apart from chapter 8 that uses only the jars for runnning a standalone distance the other chapter examples heavily depends of the server running in a standalone instance.

Because I never really appreciate the Eclipse ecosystem the whole book examples are based on NetBeans develpment platform. 

You need it for compiling the code (I told you it is a little bit outdated!). Once you download the single folder or the chapter the nbproject folder have the file that can be opened from NetBeans.  

If you need a copy of the book, in some pirate sites or libgen, you could find the PDF. 

However, please rememenber that it took mee six month to write it while I was struggling with my babies during the night. 

So I invest on the writing process my most unvaluable resource: my personal time.

In case you would not like to spend 27$ on Amazon [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/HornetQ-Messaging-Developers-Guide-Giacomelli-ebook/dp/B009X5KIGE/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=hornetq&qid=1599849896&sr=8-1) to buy it, you could at least buy me a coffee

Otherwise, nevermind I will not search you to grab my money back.Karma will do it for me :-). My Linkedin profile is this https://www.linkedin.com/in/pgiacome/. 

I am still open to solve some issues however keep in mind that I have a 9-18 work, so I can take a look at the issues in my spare time, and maybe I have better things to do.

If someone would like to contribute (some unit test maybe...),  feel free to download,fork the code and contact me to improve it.
